# Project 2: Landing Page

The purpose of the project is to create a navigation bar for the landing page using javascript. The navigation bar will be higlighted when the mouse enters a list item and will unhighlight when the cursor leaves. For each section, the list item will be highlighted when the mouse cursor is over that section.

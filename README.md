# Project 2: Landing Page

## Desription

The purpose of the project is to create a navigation bar for the landing page using javascript. The navigation bar has four sections that will jump to a specific location when a section is clicked. Also, each section on the bar will be higlighted when the mouse is hovers over and will unhighlight when the cursor leaves. In addition, for each section, the list item will be highlighted when the mouse cursor is over that section. My goal was to implement all the neccessary elements using JS rather that stating them directly on the html file.

### Creating the Navigation Bar

The function **ele** will create and append a specified number of elements to the target.
